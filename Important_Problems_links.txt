EasyAccuracy: 42.82%Submissions: 76015Points: 2
Given an array of distinct integers. The task is to count all the triplets such that sum of two elements equals the third element.
 
Example 1:

Input:
N = 4
arr[] = {1, 5, 3, 2}
Output: 2
Explanation: There are 2 triplets: 
1 + 2 = 3 and 3 +2 = 5 
â€‹Example 2:

Input: 
N = 3
arr[] = {2, 3, 4}
Output: 0
Explanation: No such triplet exits

Jon and Arya are playing a game. Rules of game as follows:
·  They have a single number N initially.
·   Both will play an alternate move. Jon starts first.
·   Both will play each move optimally.
·   In each move, they can perform only one of these operation
          1. Divide that number by 2, 3, 4 or 5 and take floor of result.
          2. Subtract that number by 2, 3, 4 or 5.
·   If after making a move the number becomes 1, the player who made the move automatically loses the game.
· When number becomes zero, the game will stop and the player who can't make a move loses the game.

 

Example 1:

Input:
N = 3
Output:
Jon
Explanation:
Jon will just subtract 3 from initial
number and win the game.
