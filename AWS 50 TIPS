AWS Solutions architect top 50 Tips:

Tip 1: High availability = Load balancer + ASG + Multi AZ.
Whenever there is question on high availability
rule out the answers saying only load balancer or Auto scaling groups or multi AZ, pick up the answer only if there is load balancer+ASG+Multi AZ is there

TIP 2: Millions of trasactions = Network Load balancer
       TCP/UDP Traffic = Network Load balancer.
Whener there is millions of trasactions mentioned in the question, Network load balancer is always correct.
And also same applies to TCP/UDP traffic also.

TIP 3: Intelligent Load balancer = Application Load balancer
       SSL termination =  Application Load Balancer
       HTTP/HTTPS = Application Load balancer

TIP 4: High Availability = Think about only high availability
If they ask about high availability, think about just high avaialbility only. Don't bother about cost optimization.

TIP 5: Cost Optimization = Think about only cost optimization.
And vice versa for Cost optimization. If they ask about cost optimization, Think about only cost optimization only. Dont mind about high availability.

TIP 6: HPC(High performance compute) = Amazon Luster/AWS Instance store
      Big data/haddop = FSX Luster
    
TIP 7: Rest API = Amazon API Gateway.

TIP 8: API Gateway = answer is more related to Lambda(most of the cases).

TIP 9: Windows file server share service = SMB/FSX
      Linux file server share service = NFS
      
TIP 10: Restrict S3 bucket access = most likely bucket policies.
There are several ways to restrict s3 bucket like IAM roles but most likely the answer would be S3 bucket policies only.

TIP 11: Unaware of file movemenet in S3 = S3 intelligent-tiering
Unaware of file movement: We can't sepcify the accessibility of files like we dont know when to retieve the files and how often we can retrieve them.

TIP 12: S3 replication = S3 versioning is must.

TIP 13: Encrypt RDS instance = Encrypts backups and snapshots.
When we encrpty RDS instance, the backups and snapshots coming from the RDS are also encrypted.

TIP 14:real time streams = kinesis streams

TIP 15: Near real time streams = kinesis firehose

TIP 16: S3 Encryption = SSE/CSE/AWS enryption
Minimum 2 questions will come for sure.

TIP 17: Recovering deleted file from S3 =  S3 versioning must be enabled.

TIP 18: NAT Gateway vs NAT Instance - importance must be known
When we need internet connection in public subnet we must need NAT Gateway, and this NAT Gateway can be created only in public subnet.

TIP 20: Security group: Stateful and only inbbound rules are defined
Network ACLs = Stateless and both inbound and outbound rules can be defined
Security groups are first layer of deffense offered at instance level and Network ACLs are offered the second  layer of deffense in subnet level.

TIP 21: common web exploiting - WAF
Advanced DDOS support = AWS Shield advanced with respective security only.

TIP 22: AWS Cloud watch - Metrics for every AWS service.
        AWS cloudtrail - API calls tracking
        AWS config - compliance of resources/auditing & recording compliance of AWS resources.
        
TIP 23: RPO = recorvery point objective
        RTO = recovery time objective.

TIP 24: More load on RDS, what do you do for read-only traffic?
ans: Create Read Replica and change connection strings in the application.

TIP 25: Big data processing = elastic map reduce.

TIP 26: Cross AWS account access = Through secure token service
when we want to share the resources in one account to another account and vice versa, we need to use secure token service in AWS.

TIP 27: For web identification = AWS cognito.

TIP 28: VPC peering is not transitive which means if there is VPC peering in between region A and region B, and VPC peering between
region B and region C then there will be no VPC peering in region A and region C. In that case use trasit gateways = hub & spoke models.
Use transit gateways = Hub & Spoke model.

TIP 29: Decouple/first in first out(FIFO) = SQS queue(Simple Queue service)
Push/publisher-subscriber mechanism/fan out = SNS(Simple notification service).

TIP 30: Detailed monitoring = 1 minute interval.
when we want detailed monitoring in the instance we can enable it in 1 minute interval.

TIP 31: peta bytes movement = snow mobile.

TIP 32: we can only have 1 internet gateway at max  per VPC.

TIP 33: GLOBALLY/CONTENT DISTRIBUTION/WORLWIDE/CACHING = think about cloudfront.
always remeber and pay attention to these kind of keywrods in all tips.

TIP 34: Gateway end point = only for S3 and dynamo.

TIP 35: Disaster recovery = Multi AZ RDS
for performance = read replicas

TIP 36: NO SQL = Dynamo DB
Best for MOBILE/WEB/GAMING/IOT = Dynamo DB
Unsure of database schema =  Dynamo DB.

TIP 37: business Intelligence/Data Warehousing/peta bytes of data storage = Red shift
Big data pocessing = EMR(Elastic map reduce)
If it is for storage red shift is best suited but if it is for data processing elastic map reduce is best suited.

TIP 38: Redis cache is more advanced than memecached

TIP 39: Snowball for around 70 TB
snowmobile for peta bytes of data

TIP 40: Spikes on holidays = scheduled scaling

TIP 41: Hybrid workload data processing = storage gateway
for movement+replication = data sync

TIP 42: Low latency with less cost = cloud front
Media/news = cloud front @ Edge locations.

TIP 43: No data transfer cost between EC2 and S3 in same region.
there will be no data transfer cost between ec2 and s3 in same region. VERY IMP.

TIP 44: Durable = S3 bucket. durable = can handle high peak and traffic

Tip 45: EFS for Linux and FSX for windows

TIP 46: Variable workloads = spot fleet.
A Spot Fleet is a collection, or fleet, of Spot Instances, and optionally On-Demand Instances. The Spot Fleet attempts to launch the number of Spot Instances
and On-Demand Instances to meet the target capacity that you specified in the Spot Fleet request.

TIP 47: Less than 1 sec = Aurora
When we need less than 1 sec of response or replication then the answer is most probably aurora.

TIP 48: Failover at global DNS level =  Global accelerator
when we need failover of route 53 at global level then it is possible with global accelerator.

TIP 49: infrastructure as a code/infra as a code = cloud formation.

TIP 50: Critical = fault tolerance.
